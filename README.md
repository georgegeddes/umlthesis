This is a Latex document class that attempts to follow the [UML Thesis Guide](https://www.uml.edu/registrar/docs/thesis_guide.pdf "UML Thesis Guide"). At some point it was forked off of [umlthesis](https://github.com/engaging-computing/umlthesis "msherman's umlthesis"), but it is quite different now.

To use this class, either put umlthesis in the working directory of your thesis or somewhere in your TeX path (=kspewhich tex=).
