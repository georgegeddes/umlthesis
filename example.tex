\chapter{Examples}
This chapter will show as much of the document class\footnote{This is a short footnote.} as possible. The footnotes\footnote{You'll find that this footnote is overly verbose and won't fit on a single line. If I have written the document class correctly, then the indentation will match the specification in the UML Thesis Guide.} are required to be indented in a particular way, for example.

\begin{quote}
  This is a paragraph quoted from somewhere else. It must be single-spaced and indented on both sides.
\end{quote}

In Table~\ref{tab:fruits} you can see what a table will look like. Refer to Figure~\ref{fig:square} to see a figure.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \caption[Comparison of fruits]{Only fruits of the same type may be compared safely.}
  \label{tab:fruits}
  \begin{tabular}{l|cc}
    & Apples & Oranges \\
    \hline
    Apples & yes & no \\
    Oranges & no & yes \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
